# Movie-title-autocomplete-component

In this project I use basic of HTML CSS and Java Script and little bit nodeJs.

I use the API http://www.omdbapi.com/ for getting movie and it's Director details.

To run this project run http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html on any browser.

## Specification:-
-
⭐ As a user I should be able to type and should see an auto complete of movie titles that matches to the letters typed.

⭐ As a user I should be able to select a movie title and it should be added to the field as a pill.

⭐ As a user I should be able to click outside of the auto complete and it should close the auto complete field.

⭐ As a user I should not be able to add more than 5 movies. For this i use local storage of chrome developer tool.

⭐ As a user I should be able to delete the previous pills by clicking on the “x”. But unfortunately it is not working. 
   I try a lot but due to deadline of this project I unable to resolve it.
